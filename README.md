# Connor Butterfield

I'm Connor Butterfield, a multidisciplinary creative and student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in computer science, programming, design, storytelling, and the arts. I love building cross-medium projects that inspire, connect, and make a positive impact on people's lives.

While studying Computer Science and Web Design at Brigham Young University–Idaho, I've also explored graphic design, UI/UX, music production, video editing, and creative writing. Whether I'm coding an application or composing a piece of music, I strive to bring purpose, emotion, and excellence to everything I create.

## Technologies and Tools

- I'm proficient in the following languages: C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL, Java, Rust, HTML & CSS
- I've used the following tools and programs for positions and assignments: Git / GitHub, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains Rider, MySQL Command Line &  MySQL Workbench, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Office, Google Workspace
- Professional Skills: Problem-solving, project management, professional communication, task management
- There are tons of other things I've made and worked on as well (such as music composition, video editing, creative writing, project management) that aren't linked to my professional accounts. Can you find them? They're out there, somewhere... waiting...
