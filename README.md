# Connor Butterfield

I'm Connor Butterfield, a multidisciplinary creative and student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in computer science, programming, design, storytelling, and the arts. I love building cross-medium projects that inspire, connect, and make a positive impact on people's lives.

While studying Computer Science and Web Design at Brigham Young Universityâ€“Idaho, I've also explored graphic design, UI/UX, music production, video editing, and creative writing. Whether I'm coding an application or composing a piece of music, I strive to bring purpose, emotion, and excellence to everything I create.

## About Me

- I'm currently majoring in Computer Science at BYU-Idaho, and I'm minoring in Web Design.
- My goals are to be able to take my knowledge of design, computers, and the arts and make something truly special. I'd love to enter the games industry, but even if I don't end up there, I want to find ways to use my talents and skills to uplift and support others.
- Ask me about my story, my history with computers, or the various passion projects I've worked on that have taught me leadership and communication skills!
- There are tons of other things I've made and worked on as well (such as music composition, video editing, creative writing, project management) that aren't linked to my professional accounts. Can you find them? They're out there, somewhere... waiting...

## Technologies and Tools

- I'm proficient in the following languages: C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL, Java, Rust, HTML & CSS
- I've used the following tools and programs for positions and assignments: Git / GitHub, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains Rider, MySQL Command Line &  MySQL Workbench, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Office, Google Workspace
- Professional Skills: Problem-solving, project management, professional communication, task management
